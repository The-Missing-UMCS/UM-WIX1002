## Introduction
---
The structure for the directory is as follow:

```md
|_Lab1/
    |_ L1Q1.java
    |_ L1Q2.java
    |_ L1Q3.java

|_ Lab2/
    |_L2Q1.java
    |_L2Q2.java

|_ README.md
```

Except for the problem solving:

```md
|_ Problem Solving/
    
    |_ Problem_Solving_1/
        |_ PS1Q1.java
        |_ PS1Q2.java

    |_ Problem_Solving_2/
        |_PS2Q1.java
        |_PS2Q2.java
```

## Git Command

---

Here are some of the useful git commands:

- `git add <file/folder>` 

    Add a change in the working directory to staging area
- `git add .` 

    Add all changes made in the working directory to staging area
- `git status`

    Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.

## Fun Story

---
Recentlt, I have lost every Lab and Tutorial in Eclipse. I just found it on Wednesday night (14/12/2022). Even more heartbreakingly, I didn't have any copy of them. Therefore, ***I HAVE TO REDO ALL OF THEM***, besides the one I've pushed to Gitlab/ Github (i.e Lab1 ~ Lab6), .

</br>

Lab question is freakingly difficult. Problem Solving 3 is also the same.

</br>

It takes me thousand years to complete it again. TBH, I had spent more than 12 hours over the weekend to finish these sh*t. Fortunately and finally, I've conquered it on Saturday night (17/12/2022). Yeah :)

</br>

What I wanna say is that **NEVER GIVE UP** on answering Lab questions. Keep trying. It's quite normal to spend 30 minutes or even more (say, 1 hour and even 1 whole day) just to do **ONE** question. I've tried spending 2 hours just to debug and modify `L10Q4.java`.

</br>

I attempted to use the `LinkedBlockingQueue` and `PriorityQueue` in `L10Q4.java` in order to keep the appointment in ascending order. But none of them because:

> The Iterator provided in method iterator() is not guaranteed to traverse the elements of the priority queue in any particular order. *-- Java Docs*

But I only come to know these after countless times of trials. Yes, I've wasted at least **3 HOURS** just to do this sh*t.

</br>

**So there is no need to worry about time.** Everyone is just the same.

</br>

Here are some useful debugging techniques:

1. Go <https://stackoverflow.com/>. You could find virtually all answers on it.
2. Utilize <https://www.google.com/>. It's much more stronger than you might expect.
3. Ask questions on <https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/>. chatGPT extremely useful, but never overrely on it. Never let AI to restrict your imagination.
4. Read others' code on <https://github.com/> or <https://gitlab.com/>. Programmers read more than code.
5. Start reading Java Documentation on <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/>. It provides tools and explanations you need which will make your life simpler.
6. Ask your buddy/ demo/ friends/ anyone who is good at programming.

</br>

Anyway, feel free to contact me at 017-780 9298 (Whatsapp/ Telegram) if you have any questions.

</br>

Good luck guys. You are the best.
