Living in the modern world, a person really
needs to know what he wants to do. In order to lead
a meaningful and colorful life, everyone needs
an ambition. If one does not have an ambition,
he will be like a ship sailing on the
wide sea blindly. That is why I have made up my
mind to become a reporter since my childhood.
